# Breakfast Cereal Analysis
## Exploratory Data Analysis

### Introduction
The goal of this project was to explore the cereal dataset and several different methods for predicting the missing values of price and variable CFBAI.Approved.   

### Tools
* R and Jupyter Notebook 
* Packages
  * ggplot2
  * tidyverse
  * recipes
  * coin
  * rpart
  * dplyr
  * leaps
  * glmnet
  * parsnip
  * kknn
  * rsample
  * ranger
  * yardstick

### Data
Cereal data collected by Prof. Wynne (California State University, Fullerton) on May 1, 2019 from an Alberston's in Irvine, CA.

### Techniques Used
* Box Plots
* Histograms
* Priciple Component Analysis
* Kruskal Wallis Hypothesis Test
* Decision Tree
* Ridge Regression
* Lasso Regression 
* Linear Regression
* k-Nearest Neighbors
* Random Forest
* Bagging

### Conclusion
Through my exploratory data analysis, I was able to determine there was a linear relationship between fiber and price of cereal. Therefore, for every added gram of fiber in a cereal, the price will increase by approximately $0.09. I also determined that the location of the cereal in the aisle was significant to whether it was approved to be advertised to children or not.
